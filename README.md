hi, this is a simple project in which any one can change title and deals. it will update it. it will give some taste of dynamic card.
it can also take the rating in stars and change the color of stars as per ratting given by you and will also count the ratting stars.😊
i created it using html css and js. writing some functions in js as a beginner was a fun and somehow frustrating process. by the way enjoyed alot. you can also try it.
